/**
 * Gather Data: Use the weather.gov API to collect weather data. The National Weather Service (NWS) API allows developers access to critical forecasts, alerts, and observations, along with other weather data1.
    Prepare Data: Clean and preprocess the data to make it suitable for use in your machine learning model.
    Choose a Model: Select an appropriate machine learning algorithm for your problem. For example, you could use a convolutional neural network to develop a machine learning weather prediction system2.
    Train: Train your model on the prepared weather data.
    Evaluate: Evaluate the performance of your model.
    Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the hyperparameters of your model to improve its performance.
    Predict: Use your trained model to make predictions about future weather conditions.
